  <h2> About Me </h2>
<p>  After graduating from Northridge University with a bachelors degree in Information Technology, I decided to pursue my education in web development at Thinkful. Here I have been able to polish my web development skills and improve my tool set. For me, web development is an art that allows creativity to be combined with the technical skills needed to deliver an exceptional artistic product. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and truly believe I can contribute consistently to a larger shared goal of a web development team.In my spare time I enjoy playing acoustic and electric guitar and have been a performing musician for the last 10 years. As a songwriter I have learned the importance of being a part of a cohesive team and working toward a common goal.   If your looking for a developer with real passion for creation please don't be afraid to contact me. I'm  excited to work with you in the future and I plan to exceed your expectations of how good your website can really be.
