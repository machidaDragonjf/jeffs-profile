  <h3> About Me </h3>
<p>  After graduating from Northridge University with a bachelors in Information Technology, I decided to further pursue my education and passion in web development at Thinkful. Here I have been able to polish my skills in web development and improve my toolset. For me, web development is a passion that allows creativity to be combined with the technical skills to deliver an exceptional artistic creation. I enjoy collaboration with other developers and truely believe I can contribute to a larger shared goal along a web development team.In my spare time I enjoy playing acoustic and electric guitar and have been a performing musician for the last 10 years. As a songwriter I have learned the importance of being a part of a cohesive team and working toward a common goal.   If your looking for a developer with real passion for creation don't be afraid to contact me. I'm so excited to work with you in the future and plan to exceed your expectations of how good your website can really be.
